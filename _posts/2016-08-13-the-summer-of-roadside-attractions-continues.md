title: "The summer of roadside attractions continues!"
---

It’s been a busy summer here at the Large Roadside Attractions of Canada head office. We’ve added a bunch of new roadside attractions to the site, and there are more to come once I catch up on the backlog that accumulated while we were on [vacation](http://blog.roadsideattractions.ca/2016/07/31/EasterEggHunt-in-Alberta/) in Edmonton (photo radar capital of Canada).

We’re also testing a potential new look for the site - check out our [demo page](http://roadsideattractions.ca/demo.html) and give us your [feedback](mailto:roadsides@roadsideattractions.ca).

**New roadside attractions recently added to the site:**

* a [husky](http://roadsideattractions.ca/mcbridehusky.html) in McBride, British Columbia, with thanks to Angie Joiner 

* Adirondack chairs (a perennial favorite within the roadside attraction community) in both [Winnipeg](http://roadsideattractions.ca/winchair.html), Manitoba, and in [Kitchener](http://roadsideattractions.ca/kchair.html), Ontario, with thanks to Boris Kohut and Justin Atkins (Distinctly Patio), respectively

* [Wheat Stalks](http://roadsideattractions.ca/wheatmelville.html) in Melville, Saskatchewan, and what I can only imagine must be the world’s largest [Oat Stem](http://roadsideattractions.ca/oatstem.html) in Ituna, Saskatchewan, both with thanks to Richard Donnan, a frequent contributor to this site who also maintains a great website of his many, many photographs of [roadside objects](http://www.roadsideobjects.com/)

* a [dinosaur](http://roadsideattractions.ca/bdino.html) (which I assume is smaller than life-sized, but which still made the cut) and a [cactus](http://roadsideattractions.ca/bcactus.html), both in Breslau, Ontario, and both with thanks to my parents, Leo & Liz van Bodegom

* some [Big Blue Chairs](http://roadsideattractions.ca/bluechair.html) in Kincardine, Ontario, with thanks to Tina Ritu

* a bunch of [Flowers](http://roadsideattractions.ca/flowers.html) in Endiang, Alberta, with thanks to Dale Redekopp
