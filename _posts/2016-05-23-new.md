**New roadside attractions added to the site:**

* [Female House Sparrow](http://roadsideattractions.ca/sparrow2.html) in Vancouver and [Carved Bench](http://roadsideattractions.ca/bench.html) in Chetwynd, British Columbia, both with thanks to [Angie Joiner](mailto:shoutenshi@gmail.com) (who, it would appear, can tell the difference between a male and a female house sparrow).

**Updated location (in Google Maps):**

* [Wheelchair](http://roadsideattractions.ca/wheelchair.html) in Williams Lake, British Columbia -- It is now located at the visitor's centre. GPS: N52° 07.362 W122° 05.946. (Thanks for the update, [Angie Joiner](mailto:shoutenshi@gmail.com).)

**Archived:**

* [Easter Seal Bear](http://roadsideattractions.ca/pgbear.html) (Prince George, British Columbia) -- The house does not belong to the Easter Seals anymore and the bear has been moved. If you know where the bear has been relocated to, [let us know](mailto:roadsides@roadsideattractions.ca). (Thanks for the update, [Angie Joiner](mailto:shoutenshi@gmail.com).)
