title: "Summer's almost over - but there's still time to get out and see some roadside attractions"
--- 

We’re still catching up on the backlog of new photos submitted this summer, so you’ll want to keep an eye on our list of [new additions](http://roadsideattractions.ca/whatsnew.html) to the site.

Also, we’re still working on a refreshed look for the site - check out our [demo page](http://roadsideattractions.ca/demo.html) and give us your [feedback](mailto:roadsides@roadsideattractions.ca).

* we approve of the eradication of mosquitoes, but, even so, we’re sad to hear that the [Mosquito ](http://roadsideattractions.ca/lmosquito.html)in Lakefield ON has been removed 

**Update:**

The mystery of the freshly painted Chetwynd Lumberjack deepens! It turns out that the [original lumberjack](http://roadsideattractions.ca/clumberjack.html) was moved (to N55°41.732 W121°38.447), and a [new lumberjack](http://roadsideattractions.ca/lcra1455.html) replaced it at the original location (N55°41.824 W121°37.981). Now Chetwynd has two large roadside lumberjacks - but why?
