Just in time for Canada's 150th birthday, we have published our 1500th roadside attraction!

Appropriately, number 1500 is a [Silver Maple Key](http://roadsideattractions.ca/roadside/lcra1509).

Of the roadside attractions that we have published since 1998, about 150 have been removed (although we suspect that there are a number that are still on the site that should be archived -- [let us know](mailto:roadsides@roadsideattractions.ca) if there are any roadside attractions that have gone missing). 

We have just over 1350 roadside attractions still listed on the site. See how many you can visit and discovery during this upcoming Canada Day long weekend!
