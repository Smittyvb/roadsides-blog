[Lorraine Hirning](mailto:hirning@shaw.ca) was instrumental in keeping this site going when our founder, [Ed Solonyka](http://blog.roadsideattractions.ca/2016/05/22/our-founder/), passed away almost a year ago. And her summer vacation brought lots of new B.C. roadside attractions to the site. As always: thanks, Lorraine!
