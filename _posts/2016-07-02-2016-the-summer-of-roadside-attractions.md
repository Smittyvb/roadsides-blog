**New roadside attraction added to the site:**

* Enjoy your trip to (or through) Simcoe, Ontario, a little bit more than normal: swing by the [Simcoe Chicken](http://roadsideattractions.ca/chicken.html).

**Recent updates:**

* The location of the [Minden Shoe Tree](http://roadsideattractions.ca/shoetree.html) is shrouded in mystery and legend. We say it is at N44°55.426 W78°38.891, and the [Google Map](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1n9BYTMRAXcuawwWFeLr7Tqav2qc&usp=sharing) that we maintain unreservedly agrees with us. [Others, however, disagree](http://www.howtosurvivelifeinthesuburbs.com/2014/08/chasing-down-an-urban-legend-the-minden-shoe-tree.html).

* The [Open Book](http://roadsideattractions.ca/openbook.html) has been moved from the side of Highway 401 at Pearson Airport to its new home in [Mississauga Celebration Square](http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/programs/metromorning/book-sculpture-mississauga-1.3575685). Coordinates have been updated in our [Google Map](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1n9BYTMRAXcuawwWFeLr7Tqav2qc&usp=sharing). I’m pretty sure that the [Airplane](http://roadsideattractions.ca/airplane.html) sculpture was installed at that same location on the airport grounds just off the 401 - does anyone know if it has been relocated somewhere? [Let us know](mailto:roadsides@roadsideattractions.ca).

**Archived:**

* [Faces](http://roadsideattractions.ca/faces.html) in Saskatoon seems to have been removed. I can’t believe it’s gone for good - does anyone know if it has been moved somewhere?

* The [Stone Arch](http://roadsideattractions.ca/stonearch.html) in Toronto has been archived. As nearly as we can tell, the "Stone Arch" was never a roadside attraction in its own right - it is actually the bottom half of a large inuksuk located by Coronation Park.

* In a disappointing and, frankly, shocking development for northwestern Ontario, the [Giant Moose Antler Rack](http://roadsideattractions.ca/antlerrack.html) in Upsala has been removed. Apparently, the new owner of the place has a different (and, it goes without saying, much worse) sense of appropriate northern taste, decorum and propriety. Other than that, though, I hear good things about the new owner.

* On a sad personal note, the [Police Patrol Car](http://roadsideattractions.ca/patrolcar.html) has been removed from the roof of the Crossroads Antique Market in Cainsville, Ontario. This was the first roadside attraction that [Mira and I ](mailto:roadsides@roadsideattractions.ca)found after discovering this website many years ago, and we still drop in at the flea market when we are in the area. The patrol car is now rusting away behind the chip stand.
